      <p>Attribution Notice
        This project is entirely based on a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp, 
        and I did not write any of the code myself. 
        All credit for the code goes to FreeCodeCamp and the original author of the lesson. 
        You can find the tutorial I followed here:
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#review-js-fundamentals-by-building-a-gradebook-app">Courses Link</a>
        I built this project as a learning exercise to better understand how the code works and is structured. 
        While I didn’t modify or write any of the code myself, going through the tutorial helped me grasp key concepts. 
        If you’re interested in learning the same, I highly recommend checking out FreeCodeCamp’s resources!</p>
